         <h1>Introduce Yourself</h1>
  <h2>I am a second-semester senior at the University of Pittsburgh. Currently, I am mostly fulfilling my 120 credits to graduate, so I'm taking classes that I thought would be fun: Detective Fiction, Fiction Writing, and Writing Youth Literature. I live with my mom, who has taught me the importance of a good work ethic, and dad, who has taught me how to work with different audiences. We have two family dogs, a dachshund nameed Bacon and a German Shepard mutt named Toast, as well as my personal pets: at tortoise named Midor and crested gecko named Hades. Other important people in my life are my pappy, my best friend Hailey, and my boyfriend Dustin. I like to read, write, paint, and watch Netflix. My favorite shows are Lucifer and Sherlock; my favorite book at the moment is A Court of Mist and Fury by Sarah J. Maas. </h2>

  <h2> I am getting my BA in PPW, focusing in the medical and scientific track. I intern in the School of Nursing, working to assist with grants for funding research in the Hillman Cancer Center, as well as facilitating research such as the effect COVID-19 had on cancer patients receiving their treatments. I also worked in an independent study last semester to create an undergraduate course centered around the humanities in medicine.

  <h2>Having experience in Usability Testing will open a few pathways for me in my field, should I choose to branch out. In medicine especially, website usability will be vital for patients to learn about their diseases and make contact with their physicians. I am also interested in medical appliances, such as different machines and apparatuses used for at-home treatment. </h2>

         <h1>Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h1>
  <h2>Overall, my interests lay in making medicine and everything difficult that comes with it easier for ordinary people to understand, creating an environment for doctors and patients to have trusting relationships. Humans are born with an ingrained fear of the unknown. Removing these unknowns and making communication between patients and their doctors has been shown to drastically increase in effectiveness of medical treatment. I want to take everything that I have worked with surrounding medicine and sciecne, and utilize it to help others like myself, who need to rely on their doctors.</h2>
